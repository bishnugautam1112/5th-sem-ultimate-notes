### **2025 Q6 a) What is an expert system? Explain how the knowledge required for the expert system is gathered.**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note

**1. Definition of Expert System:**
An Expert System is a computer program that simulates the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience in a particular field. It captures the **expertise** of a human and allows non-experts to solve complex problems (e.g., medical diagnosis, financial planning).

**2. How Knowledge is Gathered (Knowledge Acquisition):**
The process of extracting knowledge from a human expert and structuring it into a computer-readable form is called **Knowledge Engineering**. This is the most critical and difficult phase (often called the "bottleneck" of AI).

**Methods/Techniques to Gather Knowledge:**
*   **Interviews:** The Knowledge Engineer sits with the human expert and asks questions.
    *   *Unstructured Interviews:* Casual conversation to understand the domain.
    *   *Structured Interviews:* Specific questions to extract specific rules.
*   **Observation:** The engineer watches the expert solve a real problem in real-time without interrupting.
*   **Protocol Analysis (Think Aloud):** The expert is asked to "speak their thoughts aloud" while solving a problem. The engineer records every step of their reasoning.
*   **Questionnaires:** Sending a list of written questions to multiple experts to gather broad consensus.
*   **Automated Learning:** Using machine learning algorithms to "learn" rules from a large database of past examples (e.g., medical records).

**3. Architecture of Expert System (Detailed Explanation):**

*   **Knowledge Base (The Brain's Memory):**
    *   This is the storage that contains all the **Facts** (data) and **Rules** (IF-THEN logic) of the specific domain. It is the core of the system.
*   **Inference Engine (The Reasoning Logic):**
    *   This is the processing unit. It applies the rules from the knowledge base to the facts to deduce new information. It uses two strategies:
        *   *Forward Chaining:* Starts with facts $\rightarrow$ finds conclusion.
        *   *Backward Chaining:* Starts with goal $\rightarrow$ finds supporting facts.
*   **User Interface (The Bridge):**
    *   Allows the non-expert user to query the system and view the advice. It translates user English into machine code and vice versa.
*   **Working Memory (Blackboard):**
    *   A temporary storage that holds the specific facts of the *current* problem being solved (e.g., "Patient A has a fever"). It gets cleared after the problem is solved.
*   **Explanation Facility (The "Why" Module):**
    *   A unique feature of expert systems. It explains **reasoning** to the user (e.g., "I concluded X because Rule 5 was triggered by symptom Y"). This builds trust.
*   **Knowledge Acquisition Facility:**
    *   A tool that allows the expert or engineer to add, update, or delete rules in the knowledge base without rewriting the main program code.
