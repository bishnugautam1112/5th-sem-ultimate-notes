**3. Does ChatGPT have Intelligence?**
**Yes**, ChatGPT possesses "Narrow" or "Weak" Artificial Intelligence. It does not have consciousness, but it exhibits intelligence through:
*   **Contextual Understanding:** It "remembers" previous parts of a conversation to provide relevant answers.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** It processes and generates human-like text by identifying patterns in massive datasets (LLM - Large Language Model).
*   **Problem Solving:** It can solve logical puzzles, write code, and explain complex theories.
*   **Adaptability:** It can change its tone (formal/informal) and format based on user instructions.

**Conclusion:** While it lacks a soul or real emotions, its ability to **process, learn from data, and provide rational responses** makes it an intelligent agent.
