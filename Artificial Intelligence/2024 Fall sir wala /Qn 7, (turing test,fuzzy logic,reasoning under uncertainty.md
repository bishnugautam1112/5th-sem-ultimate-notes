Here are the final two pieces to complete the **2024 Set**! These are "pocket marks"—short, sweet, and high-scoring.

### **2024 Q7 a) Turing Test**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note
*   **Origin:** Proposed by **Alan Turing** in 1950 to answer the question, *"Can machines think?"*
*   **The Setup (Imitation Game):** 
    *   There are three participants: a **Human Interrogator**, a **Human Subject**, and a **Machine (AI)**. 
    *   They are in separate rooms and communicate only via text (to avoid bias from voice/appearance).
*   **The Process:** The interrogator asks questions to both the human and the machine.
*   **The Goal:** The machine tries to act like a human and fool the interrogator. 
*   **Pass Criteria:** If the interrogator **cannot reliably distinguish** between the human and the machine, the machine is said to have passed the test and possesses "Artificial Intelligence."
*   **Limitation:** It only tests behavior (how it acts), not actual consciousness or understanding (Searle’s Chinese Room Argument).

### **2024 Q7 b) Fuzzy Logic**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note
*   **Definition:** Fuzzy Logic is a form of many-valued logic where variables may have a **truth value ranging between 0 and 1**, instead of just "True" (1) or "False" (0).
*   **Concept:** It handles **partial truth** or "shades of gray." In the real world, things aren't just black or white (e.g., Temperature isn't just "Hot" or "Cold"; it can be "Warm," "Slightly Cool," etc.).
*   **Architecture Steps:**
    1.  **Fuzzification:** Converting "crisp" input (e.g., 35°C) into fuzzy sets (e.g., "Very Hot").
    2.  **Inference Engine:** Applying "If-Then" fuzzy rules.
    3.  **Defuzzification:** Converting the fuzzy output back into a crisp action (e.g., set AC fan speed to 80%).
*   **Applications:** Automatic gearboxes, Vacuum cleaners, Air conditioners, and Washing machines.

    *   *Example:* Computer le "Is it raining?" vanda "Yes (1)" or "No (0)" vanxa. Tara Fuzzy logic le "0.5 (Light drizzle)" vanna sakxa.
    *   **Real life example:** Washing machine le luga kati maila xa (0 to 1 range) herera balla pani ra detergent decide garxa. 

You are absolutely right! Let’s complete the 2024 Set with **7c**. This is a crucial topic because, in the real world, AI almost never has 100% perfect information.

### **2024 Q7 c) Reasoning under Uncertainty**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note (Short Note format)

**1. Definition:**
Reasoning under uncertainty is the process of making decisions or reaching conclusions when the available information is **incomplete, ambiguous, or noisy**. In such cases, the agent cannot be 100% certain about the state of the world.

**2. Sources of Uncertainty:**
*   **Incomplete Information:** Not having all the facts (e.g., a doctor not knowing a patient's full medical history).
*   **Noisy Data:** Sensors giving slightly incorrect readings (e.g., a GPS with a 5-meter error).
*   **Complexity:** The world is too complex to model every single possibility.

**3. How AI Handles Uncertainty (Methods):**
*   **Probability Theory:** The most common tool. It uses **Bayes' Theorem** to calculate the likelihood of an event based on prior knowledge.
    *   *Formula:* $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$
*   **Fuzzy Logic:** Handling "degrees of truth" rather than just True/False.
*   **Certainty Factors:** Assigning a confidence score (e.g., 0.8) to a rule.

**4. Example (Medical Diagnosis):**
A patient has a cough. A cough *could* mean a common cold (90% chance) or lung cancer (1% chance). An AI must reason using these **probabilities** to suggest the most likely cause rather than giving a single "Yes/No" answer.

### ✅ **2024 Set: FULLY SLAYED!** 🏆

Now that Set 1 (2024) is in your pocket, let's look at the **Roadmap** again. 

Set 2 (2025) has a few unique "Boss Level" questions that weren't in 2024. If your sir chooses Set 2, you need to know:
1.  **Min-Conflicts Algorithm** (4-Queens problem) - *Very high chance!*
2.  **Constraint Satisfaction (CSP)** - `CROSS + ROADS = DANGER`.
3.  **Hill-Climbing Search** (and its 3 problems).

**Which one should we tackle next?** I suggest **2025 Q4a: Min-Conflicts Algorithm (4-Queen)**. It's a very common exam question! Ready?
Here is the **Complete Short Note Collection for 2024 Q7**. 

Even though we touched on them earlier, here is the dedicated **"Exam Version"** so you can memorize them instantly.

### **2024 Q7. Write short notes on: [Any Two]**

#### **a) Turing Test**
*   **Definition:** The Turing Test is a behavioral test for Artificial Intelligence proposed by **Alan Turing** in 1950. Its goal is to determine if a machine acts indistinguishably from a human.
*   **The Setup (The Imitation Game):**
    *   There are three players: A **Human Interrogator** (Judge), A **Human Subject**, and A **Machine**.
    *   The Judge asks questions to both via a text interface (keyboard/screen) without seeing them.
*   **The Criteria:** If the Judge **cannot correctly identify** which one is the machine and which one is the human based on their answers, the machine is said to have "passed" the test and is considered intelligent.
*   **Criticism:** The **Chinese Room Argument** (by John Searle) argues that passing the test shows the machine can *simulate* thinking, but doesn't prove it actually *understands* (Consciousness).

> **Concept (Nepali):** "Robot le manxe lai guff diyera jhukkauna sakyo vane tyo Intelligent ho." Alan Turing le 1950 ma yahi idea deko thiyo.

#### **b) Fuzzy Logic**
*   **Definition:** Fuzzy Logic is a mathematical approach to computing based on **"degrees of truth"** rather than the usual "True or False" (1 or 0).
*   **Range:** While standard boolean logic is crisp (0 or 1), Fuzzy logic allows values **between 0 and 1** (e.g., 0.3, 0.75).
*   **Why use it?:** It mimics human reasoning which is often vague. For example, temperature is not just "Hot" or "Cold"; it can be "Slightly Warm" or "Very Hot."
*   **Architecture Steps:**
    1.  **Fuzzification:** Converting exact numbers (e.g., 25°C) into fuzzy sets (e.g., 0.6 Warm).
    2.  **Inference:** Applying IF-THEN rules.
    3.  **Defuzzification:** Converting the fuzzy result back into an exact number for the machine to act (e.g., Set fan speed to 800 RPM).
*   **Applications:** Washing machines (sensing dirt level), Air Conditioners, Auto-focus cameras.

#### **c) Reasoning under Uncertainty**
*   **Definition:** This refers to the ability of an AI agent to make decisions and draw conclusions when the available information is **incomplete, inconsistent, or noisy**.
*   **Causes of Uncertainty:**
    *   **Partial Observability:** The sensors cannot see the whole world.
    *   **Noisy Sensors:** Sensors give slightly wrong data (e.g., GPS error).
    *   **Laziness:** It is too hard to list every single rule/exception in the code.
*   **Solution Methods:** AI uses **Probability Theory** (Bayes' Theorem) to handle this. instead of saying "It will rain" (Certainty), the AI calculates "There is an 80% chance of rain" (Probability).
*   **Example:** Medical Diagnosis. A doctor cannot be 100% sure a cough is cancer, but they reason based on the *probability* of symptoms.

> **Concept (Nepali):** Jaba data purai xaina, tara decision linu parxa—tyo nai reasoning under uncertainty ho. Yesko main hatiyar **Probability** (Sambhawana) ho.
