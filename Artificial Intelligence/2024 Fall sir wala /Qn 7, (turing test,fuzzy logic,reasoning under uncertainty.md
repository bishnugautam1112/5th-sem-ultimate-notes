Here are the final two pieces to complete the **2024 Set**! These are "pocket marks"—short, sweet, and high-scoring.

### **2024 Q7 a) Turing Test**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note
*   **Origin:** Proposed by **Alan Turing** in 1950 to answer the question, *"Can machines think?"*
*   **The Setup (Imitation Game):** 
    *   There are three participants: a **Human Interrogator**, a **Human Subject**, and a **Machine (AI)**. 
    *   They are in separate rooms and communicate only via text (to avoid bias from voice/appearance).
*   **The Process:** The interrogator asks questions to both the human and the machine.
*   **The Goal:** The machine tries to act like a human and fool the interrogator. 
*   **Pass Criteria:** If the interrogator **cannot reliably distinguish** between the human and the machine, the machine is said to have passed the test and possesses "Artificial Intelligence."
*   **Limitation:** It only tests behavior (how it acts), not actual consciousness or understanding (Searle’s Chinese Room Argument).

### **2024 Q7 b) Fuzzy Logic**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note
*   **Definition:** Fuzzy Logic is a form of many-valued logic where variables may have a **truth value ranging between 0 and 1**, instead of just "True" (1) or "False" (0).
*   **Concept:** It handles **partial truth** or "shades of gray." In the real world, things aren't just black or white (e.g., Temperature isn't just "Hot" or "Cold"; it can be "Warm," "Slightly Cool," etc.).
*   **Architecture Steps:**
    1.  **Fuzzification:** Converting "crisp" input (e.g., 35°C) into fuzzy sets (e.g., "Very Hot").
    2.  **Inference Engine:** Applying "If-Then" fuzzy rules.
    3.  **Defuzzification:** Converting the fuzzy output back into a crisp action (e.g., set AC fan speed to 80%).
*   **Applications:** Automatic gearboxes, Vacuum cleaners, Air conditioners, and Washing machines.

### 🧠 Core Concept Guide (Romanized Nepali + English)

**Concept bujhne tarika (How to remember in 1 minute):**

*   **Turing Test (Robot ko Interview):** Robot le manxe lai "Ma pani manxe nai ho" vanera jhukkauna sakyo vane test pass hunxa. Alan Turing le 1950 ma nikaleko logic ho yo. **Keyword:** *Imitation Game.*
*   **Fuzzy Logic (Bich ko kura):** Standard logic ma "Yes" or "No" matra hunxa. Fuzzy ma "Thikai" ya "Ali ali" pani hunxa. 
    *   *Example:* Computer le "Is it raining?" vanda "Yes (1)" or "No (0)" vanxa. Tara Fuzzy logic le "0.5 (Light drizzle)" vanna sakxa.
    *   **Real life example:** Washing machine le luga kati maila xa (0 to 1 range) herera balla pani ra detergent decide garxa. 

You are absolutely right! Let’s complete the 2024 Set with **7c**. This is a crucial topic because, in the real world, AI almost never has 100% perfect information.

### **2024 Q7 c) Reasoning under Uncertainty**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note (Short Note format)

**1. Definition:**
Reasoning under uncertainty is the process of making decisions or reaching conclusions when the available information is **incomplete, ambiguous, or noisy**. In such cases, the agent cannot be 100% certain about the state of the world.

**2. Sources of Uncertainty:**
*   **Incomplete Information:** Not having all the facts (e.g., a doctor not knowing a patient's full medical history).
*   **Noisy Data:** Sensors giving slightly incorrect readings (e.g., a GPS with a 5-meter error).
*   **Complexity:** The world is too complex to model every single possibility.

**3. How AI Handles Uncertainty (Methods):**
*   **Probability Theory:** The most common tool. It uses **Bayes' Theorem** to calculate the likelihood of an event based on prior knowledge.
    *   *Formula:* $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$
*   **Fuzzy Logic:** Handling "degrees of truth" rather than just True/False.
*   **Certainty Factors:** Assigning a confidence score (e.g., 0.8) to a rule.

**4. Example (Medical Diagnosis):**
A patient has a cough. A cough *could* mean a common cold (90% chance) or lung cancer (1% chance). An AI must reason using these **probabilities** to suggest the most likely cause rather than giving a single "Yes/No" answer.

### 🧠 Core Concept Guide (Romanized Nepali + English)

**Concept bujhne tarika (How to remember in 1 minute):**

*   **Reasoning Under Uncertainty:** Yo vaneko "Dubidha ma nirnaya line" (Making decisions in doubt) technique ho. 
*   **Real World Logic:** Real world ma sabai kura 100% thaxaina hami lai. Jastai: "Aaja paani parla?" vanda hami "Yes" ya "No" vanna sakdainau. Hami k vanxau? "70% chance xa parla." Tei nai Uncertainty reasoning ho.
*   **Method:** Yesma main hero **"Probability"** ho. "Certainty" (pakkai) ko satta hami "Likelihood" (huna sakne asha) ko kura garxau.
*   **Keywords for marks:** incomplete data, noisy sensors, Bayes' Theorem, Probability.

### ✅ **2024 Set: FULLY SLAYED!** 🏆

Now that Set 1 (2024) is in your pocket, let's look at the **Roadmap** again. 

Set 2 (2025) has a few unique "Boss Level" questions that weren't in 2024. If your sir chooses Set 2, you need to know:
1.  **Min-Conflicts Algorithm** (4-Queens problem) - *Very high chance!*
2.  **Constraint Satisfaction (CSP)** - `CROSS + ROADS = DANGER`.
3.  **Hill-Climbing Search** (and its 3 problems).

**Which one should we tackle next?** I suggest **2025 Q4a: Min-Conflicts Algorithm (4-Queen)**. It's a very common exam question! Ready?
