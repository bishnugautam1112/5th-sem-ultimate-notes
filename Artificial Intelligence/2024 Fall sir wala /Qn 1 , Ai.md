### **2024 Q1 a). Define Artificial Intelligence. Is the ChatGPT an intelligent agent? If yes, explain in detail.**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note (Write this to get full marks)
**1. Definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computer science that deals with creating smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It is the study of agents that **perceive** their environment, **reason**, and take **actions** to maximize their chance of achieving a specific goal.
*(Keywords to include: Perceive, Reason, Act, Rationality).*

**2. Is ChatGPT an Intelligent Agent?**
**Yes**, ChatGPT is an intelligent agent. Specifically, it acts as a **Learning and Rational Agent** operating in a virtual environment.

**3. Detailed Explanation (Why is it an agent?):**
To prove it is an agent, we map it to the standard AI Agent framework (Sensors, Actuators, Environment):
*   **Environment:** The chat interface and the specific conversation history with the user.
*   **Percepts (Sensors):** It "perceives" by receiving text prompts, questions, or instructions typed by the user through the input field.
*   **Actions (Actuators):** It "acts" by generating and displaying text, code, or structured responses on the screen.
*   **Intelligence/Brain (Agent Function):** It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs - specifically Transformer architecture), and deep learning to analyze the input context, predict the most logical next words, and generate a highly accurate, human-like response.

*Extra flex for A+ marks:* Mention that it is not a *perfect* rational agent (it sometimes hallucinates facts) but it exhibits high-level cognitive skills like summarizing, translating, and reasoning.
