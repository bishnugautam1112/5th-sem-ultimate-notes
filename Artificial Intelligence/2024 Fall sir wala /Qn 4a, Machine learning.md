### **2024 Q4 a) Define machine learning. Explain the learning by analogy approach with suitable examples.**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note (Write this to get full marks)

**1. Definition of Machine Learning (ML):**
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables a system to automatically learn and improve from past **experience (data)** without being explicitly programmed for every step.
*   *Tom Mitchell's Scientific Definition (Write this for extra marks!):* A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance on **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.

**2. Learning by Analogy:**
Learning by analogy is a reasoning process where a system solves a *new* problem (Target Domain) by finding similarities with an *already solved* past problem (Source Domain), and then transferring that knowledge.
Instead of learning from scratch, it asks: *"What did I do the last time I faced something similar?"*

**3. Steps in Learning by Analogy:**
1.  **Retrieval:** Searching the knowledge base to find a past problem similar to the current one.
2.  **Mapping:** Identifying the matching features and establishing a connection between the old problem and the new problem.
3.  **Transfer/Application:** Using the solution from the old problem to solve the new one.
4.  **Storage:** Saving this new solved problem for future use.

**4. Suitable Examples:**
*   **Real-world Example (Medical Diagnosis):** A doctor sees a new patient with a specific set of rare symptoms (Target). The doctor remembers a past patient from 5 years ago with the exact same symptoms who was cured using "Drug X" (Source). The doctor *analogically* prescribes "Drug X" to the new patient.
*   **Scientific Example:** The structure of an Atom (Target) was understood by drawing an analogy to the Solar System (Source). 
    *   *Sun $\rightarrow$ Nucleus*
    *   *Planets orbiting $\rightarrow$ Electrons orbiting*

**Concept bujhne tarika (How to remember in 1 minute):**

*   **Machine Learning (ML) vaneko k ho?:** Machine lai k garne vanera line-by-line code n लेख्ने (not explicitly programmed). Data dine, ani machine le aafai pattern khojera sikne. Jastai: 1000 ota biralo ko photo dekhayesi, 1001 th photo dekhaunda machine le aafai "yo biralo ho" vanera chinxa.
*   **Learning by Analogy (The "Jugaad" Learning):** Purano anubhav (experience) sanga naya problem lai daanjne (compare garne). 
*   **Nepali Example for Exam memory:** "Timi lai cycle chalauna aauxa vane, scooter chalauna xito sikxau kinaki timlai balance garna aauxa." (Source: Cycle $\rightarrow$ Target: Scooter).
*   **Exam Hack:** Tom Mitchell ko "E, T, P" wala definition compulsory lekhne. Sir haru tyo definition dekhne bittikai impress hunxan. Ani "Atom ra Solar System" ko example lekhne, it's the most standard AI textbook example!
