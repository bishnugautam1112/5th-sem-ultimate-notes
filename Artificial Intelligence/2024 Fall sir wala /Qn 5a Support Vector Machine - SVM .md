### **2024 Q5 a) What is support vector machine? Explain in detail. (7 Marks)**

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note (Write this to get full marks)

**1. What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?**
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile **Supervised Machine Learning** algorithm used primarily for **Classification** (but also for Regression). 
The main objective of the SVM algorithm is to find the optimal straight line (or boundary) that separates a dataset into different classes with the maximum possible gap.

**2. Core Terminologies of SVM (The "Detail" part):**
To explain SVM, you must define these three critical terms:
*   **Hyperplane:** The decision boundary that separates the different classes. In 2D space, it's a line. In 3D space, it's a flat plane.
*   **Support Vectors:** The data points that are closest to the hyperplane. These are the most critical points because they alone dictate where the hyperplane is drawn. If you remove other points, the line won't change, but if you move a support vector, the line shifts.
*   **Margin:** The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vectors from either class. SVM is known as a **Maximum Margin Classifier** because it always tries to make this gap as wide as possible to avoid future classification errors.

**3. The Kernel Trick (For Non-Linear Data):**
What if the data cannot be separated by a straight line (e.g., a circle of red dots surrounded by a ring of blue dots)? 
SVM uses a mathematical technique called the **"Kernel Trick"**. It transforms low-dimensional input space into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separator *can* be drawn. (Examples of kernels: Linear, Polynomial, RBF).

*(Mandatory Exam Diagram: Draw a simple X-Y graph. Put some '+' signs on the top left, and '-' signs on the bottom right. Draw a solid line in the middle (Hyperplane), and dotted lines touching the closest '+' and '-' (Margin). Circle those closest points and label them "Support Vectors").*

### 🧠 Core Concept Guide (Romanized Nepali + English)

**Concept bujhne tarika (How to remember in 1 minute):**

*   **SVM ko Main Kaam:** Dui thari ko data lai chhutyauna ko lagi sab vanda "Best Line" tanne kaam ho. 
*   **Best Line (Hyperplane) kasari chhanne?:** Bato ko bich ma divider haleko jastai. Divider yesto thau ma halnu paryo jaha bata left ko gadi ra right ko gadi dubay lai maximum thau (Margin) milos.
*   **Support Vectors (Boundary ka Pahalwan haru):** Line ko sab vanda najik vaka points haru. Yini haru le nai line kata tanne vanera decide garxan. Paxadi ka points haru ko baal matlab hudaina.
*   **Kernel Trick (Jadu):** Yedi euta table ma aalu ra syau mix vayera baseko xa ra sidha lathi le chhutyauna mildaina vane, SVM le tyo table lai mathi faldinxa (3D ma lagxa), ani hawa mai euta thulo board halera chhutyaidinxa. Yeslai nai "Kernel trick" vaninxa. High dimension ma lagera solve garne!

*   **Exam Hack:** "Hyperplane", "Support Vectors", ra "Maximum Margin" — yo 3 wota word pen le underline garne exam ma. Euta graph banaune jasma bich ma line xa. Sir le thapauxa you know your stuff! Full 7 marks!
