Now, let's slay the NLP Ambiguity question. This is all about having catchy examples ready.

#### 📝 High-Yield Exam Note

Ambiguity in NLP occurs when a piece of language can be interpreted in more than one way. It happens at various levels:

**1. Phonetic Ambiguity (Sound level):**
Occurs when words sound similar but have different meanings (Homophones).
*   **Example:** *"The doctor said he would heal/heel the patient."*
*   **Ambiguity:** Is the doctor curing the patient (**heal**) or talking about the back part of the foot (**heel**)?

**2. Syntactic Ambiguity (Grammar level):**
Occurs when a sentence can be parsed into different structures.
*   **Example:** *"I saw a man with a telescope."*
*   **Ambiguity:** 
    1. I used a telescope to see the man. 
    2. The man was holding a telescope.

**3. Semantic Ambiguity (Meaning level):**
Occurs when a single word has multiple distinct meanings (Polysemy).
*   **Example:** *"The bank is closed."*
*   **Ambiguity:** Is the **financial institution** closed, or is the **land beside a river** inaccessible?

**4. Pragmatic Ambiguity (Context level):**
Occurs when the meaning depends on the context or the speaker's intent rather than just the words.
*   **Example:** *"It is cold in here."*
*   **Ambiguity:** 
    1. A simple statement of fact.
    2. A hidden request for someone to **close the window**.
